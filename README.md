# RoguelikeGame

Roguelike Game (this will *not* be the final name) is a roguelike game. Who would've known, right? This is mostly a learning project for myself, although I do intend on seeing it until the end.

## Compiling

RoguelikeGame compiles against the following:

* [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)
* [MonoGame 3.5](http://www.monogame.net/)

## Contributing

If you would like to submit your own code or any other form of content to this project, go ahead and make a pull request. Keep in mind that, given the nature of the project, I will be hesitant on accepting code submissions. However, aspects of the game that are not code-related, such as art and music, I will be much more likely to accept.

There is a list of tasks to be finished [here](https://github.com/StefenSharkey/RoguelikeGame/wiki/Completion-TODO-List).

All contributors will be credited. For now, they are located [here](https://github.com/StefenSharkey/RoguelikeGame/wiki/Contributors).
